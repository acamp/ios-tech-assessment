# Acamp iOS Exercise

In this repository you can find the instructions for the Acamp iOS Technical Assessment. 


You are expected to create a small map-based application that has 3 main features:


`1` Plot some pins on a map based on their locations coming from a local json file

`2` Show some basic information of that location in a card after the user clicks on a pin

`3` Show more detailed information about the location after the user clicks on the card.


You can take the Acamp app itself as a reference.


This is an example for feature `1`:

# General instructions
- Use Swift in your implementation
- Feel free to use any library/framework you need to implement your project
- Use the file `places.json` from this repository as a data source for your places to be plotted on the map. This json has several information from places, so use your judgment to decide which information to use for features `2` and `3`
- For feature ´2´, you can decide to either use native UI elements or build your own custom map card
- The asthetics and UI of your app will be considered secondary on this exercise, so consider it this part optional
