# Acamp iOS Exercise

In this repository you can find the instructions for the Acamp iOS Technical Assessment. 

# About the project
You are expected to create a small map-based application that has 3 main features:


`1` Plot some pins on a map based on their locations coming from a local json file

`2` Show some basic information of that location in a card after the user clicks on a pin

`3` Show more detailed information about the location after the user clicks on the card.


# References
You can take the Acamp app itself as a reference.


This is an example for feature `1`:

# General instructions
- Use Swift in your implementation
- Feel free to use any library/framework you need to implement your project
- Use the file `places.json` from this repository as a data source for your places to be plotted on the map. This json has several information from places, so use your judgment to decide which information to use for features `2` and `3`
- For feature ´2´, you can decide to either use native UI elements or build your own custom map card
- The asthetics and UI of your app will be considered secondary on this exercise, but you will gain extra points the nicer your app looks and the more realistic the end result becomes

# How to share your code
You can choose between hosting your project on your own Github or send us your project in a zip file to the email `thiago@acamp.com`.

# About the timeline
You can decide how long it will take you to complete the project. Just let us know before hand when we can expect your code.
